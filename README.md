# Hand Gesture Based System

## ✨ Introduction ✨

We are associated with Government Polytechnic Pune. As a final year project, my teammates and I developed a Hand Gesture Based System. Our project, developed using Python, MediaPipe, OpenCV, and the CVZone Hand Detector Library, is capable of accessing various functionalities and applications of a system. Just show the gestures and get your work done in no time!

## ⚒️ Working ⚒️

Our system allows users to control various applications and perform tasks using hand gestures. Here are some examples of what our project can do:
- **Open Applications**: Show the appropriate gesture to open applications like MS Word, MS Excel, MS PowerPoint, Command Prompt (CMD), File Explorer, and many more.
- **Control Applications**: Use specific gestures to perform tasks within applications, such as printing, saving, and creating new documents in MS Word.
- **Speech to Text**: Type using the Speech to Text feature, making it even easier to access and control applications.
- **Mouse Control**: Control the mouse using gestures, including left click, right click, scroll up, scroll down, etc.
